# This is a collection of lessons in Javascript.

Every script is an example of the concept it is trying to teach with a practical real world approach.

## Basic topics covered:

- Numbers
- Strings
- Operators
- Converting types
- Collection
  - Arrays
  - Sets
- Objects
- Functions
- Classes
- Next Gen classes
- Closures

### Things to note

- For a browser window, the object is "window".
  One of the objects in window is document.
  E.g : > window.document (document can be called directly too which is what everyone does.) > window.document.title

- In console, it is always available.

E.g, to find the width of the window :

    ```
    > window.innerWidth
    ```

### What is DOM

Document object mode.
Each element is a DOM node.

### DOM Methods.

- document.getElementByID
- document.querySelector (E.g: document.querySelector("#today_date"). This gives back the first element)
  '#' signifies its an ID.
- document.querySelectorAll
